#### What did you do this past week?

I started off by going over some of the class material for the test, but that took a back seat to homework from other classes. I will be diving back into studying for the test as soon as I get done with my final assignment today. I need to read the book also. I haven't exactly stayed on top of the readings. I thumbed through it and it doesn't seem too bad.

#### What's in your way?

There isn't much in my way this week. I guess the only thing would be not forgetting about the exams I have this week.

#### What will you do next week?

study. I'll start off by doing the readings, then going over the class notes. Finally I'll practice some of the coding related things we did in class. If I get I chance I should try to stop by the TA study sessions. Those would probably help prepare.

#### Tip Of The Week

I'm sure a lot of people already know about sites like [HakerRank][1] and [Interview Cake][2], but these help me prepare for my interviews.

#### What did you do this past week?
Well, since it was Thanksgiving, I was sitting at home and not doing much. Since the exam is this week, I started brushing up on some of the stuff, but I couldn't motivate myself to study too much. I still managed to go through a few of the lectures though, so it counts for something I hope. Besides that, nothing else happened this past week.

#### What's in your way?
Motivating myself to get through this final week of classes. I have so much work to do this week, I don't want to do anything, so just finding a way to plan out all the things I have to do is what I will focus on. The most immediate things will be to prepare a little bit for the presentation in this class. Then the exam, and my other exam. In between those, I'll have to make space for my essays and other presentations.

#### What will you do next week?
So, finishing work mostly. I need to study for the exam in this class more seriously than my attempt at it over break. I'll be meeting with my group today to go over our presentation. This week will be fun.

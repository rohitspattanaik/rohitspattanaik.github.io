#### What did you do this past week?

This week I started off by wrapping up the project. It ended up up taking more time than I had expected. But I still managed to turn it in so it worked out in the end. In class we worked on a few concepts like Python exception handling, using the stack and the heap, and how Python treats its variables when it comes to memory. I didn't know the intricacies when it came to how variables were treated, so going over those things in class will be particularly helpful. It was interesting to find out how Python is different in the back compared to the other languages I've worked with.

#### What's in your way?

Work from other classes is starting to pick up so I'll have to make sure I carve out enough time to work on the next project. There is still a while for the test, but I have to keep reminding myself that it's there just so that I don't fall behind on this class's work.

#### What will you do next week?

I'll be jumping on the next project as soon as we go over it in class to make sure I'm not rushing at the end to cobble something together. Other than that, I look forward to going to class and learning some more stuff.

#### Tip Of The Week

Time to start prepping for interviews if you haven't already. The career fair is next week.

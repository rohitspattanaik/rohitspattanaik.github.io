#### What did you do this past week?
I've started on the next project with my group. The theme for our project is books and there is a lot in terms of data available for us to use for this project. We took spent some time figuring out what we wanted to include and what structure our design should follow. There's a good amount of work for this project besides just the code because of all the documentation we need to write. But all in all, this looks like it is going to be a good project.

#### What's in your way?
Not much. In terms of the project, the biggest difficulty we are going to have as a group is planning around everyone's schedules. I think a few of us have interviews and trips planned for next week so we need to make sure we have the work properly delegated and nothing gets left behind.

#### What will you do next week?
Finish up the project first of all. I have a couple interviews so I need to prepare for those. Other than that, nothing else.

#### Tip Of The Week
Never worked with bootstrap too much before. Found a pretty good tutorial video. Check it out [here][1]. It's long, but there are timestamps in the description.

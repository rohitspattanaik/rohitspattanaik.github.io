#### What did you do this past week?
This week I focused on finishing the final project for this class. After the last minute rush we had last week, we found ourselves in a much better position this week. We were able to get through all of the major features we wanted our project to have and everything worked out well. The presentation was kind of bare bones, but we'll flesh it out a little more before we actually have to present. Other than that, nothing much happened this week.

#### What's in your way?
In the final few days of all my classes, its coming down to making sure I'm not missing any deadlines or important dates. Just keeping track of everything I have to do so that I don't mess up a class in the last weeks. When it comes to this class, thinking about the presentation we will have to give and the test that's coming up later on. I'll worry about that when that week comes along.

#### What will you do next week?
Nothing much hopefully. It is Thanksgiving after all.

#### Tip Of The Week
Fill out the course instructor survey for extra credit. Fill them out for your other classes anyways, it doesn't hurt or take much time at all.

#### What did you do this past week?
The past week we had guest lectures on both days. I found them pretty interesting and they gave some good insite into how their companies functioned. We also started work on the next project. We met up to figure out what everyone will be taking care of this time and I think we've planned out everything well enough. Hopefully we will be done with time to spare. Besides that, not much happened the past week.

#### What's in your way?
Not too much. Getting the project done while managing everyone's schedules will be the biggest part, but aside from that this week should be good.


#### What will you do next week?
The main thing I want to have done is the project. But after that this week looks like it is going to be more relaxed. I will also need to go vote sometime.

#### What did you do this past week?

The week started off with a guest speaker from Bloomberg. I found that pretty interesting, since it gave an honest perpective about what is involved in the industry. The tips for recruiting and interviewing were also helpful. In class we went over how the iterate over the different types of structure. Some of these things were pretty new to me and I'll be experimenting on my own with them a little bit. I've also gotten started on the next project. Since this one doesn't have a template to go off of, I wanted to start sooner to make sure I don't fall too far behind. Also, since the career fair is next week, I know that I will start to lose a lot of time on tuesday and the days after. 

#### What's in your way?

Nothing much, aside from recruiting related stuff. That will have most of my attention, and everything I do for this class and all my others will have to work around that.

#### What will you do next week?

Work on the project and get that out of the way. Aside from that, keeping up with what we are doing in class.

#### Tip Of The Week

Something that I've started doing more of is prioritizing what I need to get done when it comes to things like projects.

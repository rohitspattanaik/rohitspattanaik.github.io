#### What did you do this past week?

Not much to be perfectly honest. I strudied for the test for the first half of the week. Curious to know how the test went. I thought it was ok. The questions were direct, and were from the material covered in class with no surprises. The project just came out so I took a look at that but haven't done much about it.

#### What's in your way?

The new project since that is the only thing new in the class. I have a group, so the next step is figuring stuff out and getting to work.

#### What will you do next week?

Get together with my group and work on the project. We will need to come up with an idea, design it and decide which part of the work is better for which people.

#### What did you do this past week?

I missed class on Monday because of the career fair, so I missed the guest speaker. The career fair itself was pretty productive and I talked to a lot of interesting companies. After that, I wrapped up project two. It went pretty well, and what we had to to clicked towards the end. I guess I struggled a little bit in the beginning understanding what exactly we had to do. Getting Travis to work also took a lot of time. In the end I wasn't even sure why things we're building successfully, So I kept hacking the .travis.yml file till things finally went through.

#### What's in your way?

It was a busy week, between career events, interviews, projects and assignments. The most honest answer was that sleep was in my way.

#### What will you do next week?

I have a couple of exams coming up in the next few weeks, including this class. So, I guess I should start preparing for them. It might be worth it to start a little early, if I can motivate myself to.

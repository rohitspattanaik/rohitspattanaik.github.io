#### What did you do this past week?
The past week I finished up the prjoect with the rest of my team. It ended up taking a little longer than we had expected because of how the APIs we were using behaved, but we managed to get it done. I was handling the database side of things. We came really close to the deadline so that was fun. Maybe the next project will go better.

#### What's in your way?
Just managing the different things I have to do and making sure I don't run out of time. This is one week I need to plan out a little bit just to make sure I nothing gets left out.

#### What will you do next week?
I want to get some of the preliminary designing and planning for the project out of the way. Besides that, homework and assignments all the way.
